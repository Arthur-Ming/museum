            <p>Las Meninas is a 1656 painting by Diego Vel√°zquez, the leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age.
            </p>
            <p>It was cleaned in 1984 to remove a <span>"yellow veil"</span> of dust that had gathered since the
                previous
                restoration in the 19th
                century.</p>
            <p>The cleaning provoked furious protests, not because the picture had been damaged in any way, but
                because it looked
                different.</p>
